# Memory Game (Simon Says)

A simple **Simon Says** style memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The game shows a sequence of colored buttons lighting up, and the player must repeat the sequence in the correct order.

2. Watch the sequence of lights carefully.
3. Click the colored buttons in the same order as they lit up.
